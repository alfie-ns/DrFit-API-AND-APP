   - `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Consider Hosting Environment**:
   - Use VirtualBox, Docker, AWS, Azure, or Heroku for deployment.
   - If using a VM:
      1. Set up VM and install OS.
      2. Install dependencies on VM.
      3. Transfer code and set up the virtual environment.
      4. Configure Django application.
      5. Run the server: `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
      6. Access API: `http://VM_IP_ADDRESS:8000/api/`

### API Development
0. **Finish off plan**:
    - Finish off plan in API.md

1. **User Endpoint**:
   - CRUD operations for user management.
   - Implement token-based authentication.

2. **Exercise Endpoint**:
   - Add, edit, delete exercises.
   - Associate exercises with user profiles.

3. **Meal & Nutrition Endpoint**:
   - Add, edit, delete meals.
   - Nutrition facts and details.

### Testing
- Use Django's built-in testing framework.
- Write unit tests and mock responses.

## Frontend Development (Swift, Xcode)

### Design & Interaction
1. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Customize layout, colors, and icons.
   - Add fluid card animations, slides, fades, bounces, and 3D effects.

2. **Features**:
   - Implement quick actions, context menus, haptic feedback, etc.

### Functionality & Content
1. **General Functionalities**:
   - Asynchronous processing.
   - OpenAI integration for advice and information.
   - User profile creation and management.

2. **Content Management**:
   - Implement food search, question boxes, top comments, etc.

3. **Health & Fitness**:
   - Manage exercises, meals, goal notifications, etc.

### Testing
- Utilize XCTest for unit testing.
- Manually test on the iOS simulator or device.

## Integration

1. **Connect Xcode with Django Backend**:
   - Set API endpoint in Xcode: `http://localhost:8000/api/`
   - Handle CORS if necessary.

2. **Testing the Integration**:
   - Use unit and manual testing.
   - Debugging tools in Django and Xcode.
   - Consider integration testing tools.

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Address network issues, API contract mismatches, and environment considerations.

## Deployment and Maintenance
1. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Consider platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for hosting.

2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Submit the iOS app to the App Store.

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Regularly update based on user feedback and changing requirements.
